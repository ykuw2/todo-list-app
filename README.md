#To-Do List App

This is my second small project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspiration was taken from this site: https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich/pen/MXmzzM?editors=0110.
The main objective of this project was to utilize JavaScript as the interaction aspect of the app, such as adding a new item, deleting them, marking them as complete, etc. 
By completing this project, I learned more in depth about the user inputs and how to change them in the frontend. Most of the code is written by me; with some parts looked/used as a guide or functions I did not know much about.

If you want to try out the app, here it is: https://ykuw2.github.io/todo-list-app/. 
An example of the usage is shown below:

The items will be automatically be capitalized, and put in a "container" below the input block.
The user can put an item, with the maximum length being capped at 40 letters.
The user can then press the "X" button to delete the item or press on the item itself, which will turn green to indicate completion.
